I am broadly interested on the analysis of small RNAs through sequencing, particularly miRNAs but also tRNAs and tRNA fragments.
As part of my work at <a href='https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/'>Chair for Clinical Bioinformatics</a>, I have focused on cataloguing all 
<a href='https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/'>human isomiRs</a>, miRNA variants that can arise through post-transcriptional 
processing and editing.

Previously, I completed my PhD at University of Granada, where I was advised by Michael Hackenberg and worked on 
miRNA-seq analysis tools for quantification and quality control, supported by the iPFIS Fellowship. I also visited other 
labs at the Cancer Center Amsterdam and University of Michigan, the latter thanks to a Fulbright PhD Scholarship.

In my spare time, I try to play as much tennis as I can. I also enjoy travelling, learning new languages and spending
quality time with friends and family.
