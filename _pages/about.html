<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am broadly interested on the analysis of small RNAs through sequencing, particularly miRNAs but also tRNAs and tRNA fragments. As part of my work at <a href="https://www.ccb.uni-saarland.de/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chair for Clinical Bioinformatics</a>, I have focused on cataloguing all [human isomiRs]{https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/}, miRNA variants that can arise through post-transcriptional processing and editing.</p> <p>Previously, I completed my PhD at University of Granada, where I was advised by Michael Hackenberg and worked on miRNA-seq analysis tools for quantification and quality control, supported by the iPFIS Fellowship. I also visited other labs at the Cancer Center Amsterdam and University of Michigan, the latter thanks to a Fulbright PhD Scholarship.</p> <p>In my spare time, I try to play as much tennis as I can. I also enjoy travelling, learning new languages and spending quality time with friends and family.</p> </body></html>
